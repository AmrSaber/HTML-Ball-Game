# HTML Ball Game
I was practicing canvas with javascript some long time ago, and I made this small game (not sure if it's actually a game), I almost forgot about it, but someone thinks it's a good thing, so, here it is :D

The game is hosted on github pages [here](https://amrsaber.github.io/HTML-Ball-Game).
